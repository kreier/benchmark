## GFLOPS comparison over time

Growing up with the Cray-2 as the fastest supercomputer with more than 1 GFLOPS this remained the case almost until I finished high school in 1992. By then our new 80486 SX at school had merely 1 MFLOPS, 1000x slower and 7 years later. Consumer hardware only got to this speed in 2004 with the Athlon64, about 20 years later. Still impressive!
