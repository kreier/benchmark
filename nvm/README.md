# Historic results for non volative memory (NVM) like HDD, SSD and NVMe

Over the last 10 years the speed of non volatile storage has increased significantly. Let's take for example the hard drive in my Samsung R20 notebook from 2008 with a 120GB SATA2 drive from hitachi. For comparison a NAS drive from Western Digital from 2016, a 3TB SATA3 3.5" drive:

Switching to solid state drives the speed improves even further:

This change is one of the reasons for responsive Computers in recent years.
