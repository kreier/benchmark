# Browser Benchmarks

There is quite some history with benchmarks for browsers and JavaScript in particular. A part is the optimization over time, motivated by benchmarks, that in time got outdated or yielded the opposing effect. [Benedikt Meurer](https://benediktmeurer.de/about/) wrote an [interesting article about the optimization](https://benediktmeurer.de/2016/12/16/the-truth-about-traditional-javascript-benchmarks/) of JavaScript engines for specific types of benchmarks.

## Sunspider

Maybe the first I started? Highly deprecated!

## Peacekeeper

No longer maintaned.

## [Kraken JavaScript Benchmark 1.1](https://krakenbenchmark.mozilla.org/)

Always wondered how fast this could get. i7 scored 1159 ms and iPhone 7 just 1352 ms.

## [Octane 2.0](https://chromium.github.io/octane/)

Still one of my favourite ones, rather fast to execute. More recent ones got better as well. The i7-6820HW got 35218 points. The iPhone 7 reached 25875 points.

## [Speedometer 2.0](https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/)

My old iPhone 7 scores 69.6. While my i7-6820HQ gets 85.6 runs/min.

## [JetStream 2](https://browserbench.org/JetStream/)

Here the result is ...

And a table follows. I work on this for years!
