# Linpack benchmark in DP (double precision, 64bit)

When the initial linpack was released in 1979 minicomputers like the [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) (from 1970) had just moved from 16bit to 32bit with superminicomputers like the [VAX-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11) (1978). The supercomputer [Cray-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1) uses 64bit for data since 1975. By the time the [TOP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500) of fastest supercomputers was created in 1993 most supercomputers were using 64bit. For comparison this value is been used ever since.

64bit for normal citizens took a little longer. In 2003 AMD starts shipping the [Athlon 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlon_64) processor lines with the first x86-based 64-bit processor architecture. For smartphones to move to 64bit it took until 2013 with the [iPhone 5S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5s).

## Test with the Phoronix Test Suite

It can be installed in WSL or Ubuntu with:

``` sh
sudo apt install php php-cli php-xml
git clone https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/
cd phoronix-test-suite
sudo ./install-sh
phoronix-test-suite benchmark hpl
```

This number can be measured much faster with **OpenCL**. Some results for CPUs and GPUs are in the [GPU benchmark section](../gpu/opencl/).

In this section I also included a graph for comparison of GFLOPS with DP (fp64) from the fastest supercomputer of their time to consumer hardware a few years later ([source Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QBJVa8wzo4B1aygXrlk0FWpG4UVwWn3Zo5LsfNnlJM/edit?usp=sharing)):

## HPL by Intel

The multithread version to measure the performance of supercomputers there is the High Performance Linpack:

- [https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/)

But you can't just download it and make/compile the benchmark and run it. You need MPI, BLAS and VSIPL. A simple solution is to download the compiled binaries from Intel

- [https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-benchmarks-suite.html](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-benchmarks-suite.html)

For my i7-6820HQ it reached a maximum of 99.9978 GFlops for a size of 27000. That's $10^{11}$.
